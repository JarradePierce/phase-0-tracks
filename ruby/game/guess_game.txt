Guessing game
1. one user can enter a word and another user attempts to guess the word.
2. Guesses are limited and the number of guesses avaliable is related to the length of the word
3. Repeated guesses do not count against the user
4. The guessing player recieves continual feedback on the current state of the word. So if the secret word is "Unicorn" the user will start out seeing something like "-------" wich would become "---c---" afer the user enters a guess of 'c'.
5. The user should get a congratulartory message if they win, and a taunting message if they lose.(allow the creator of the word create a taunt)
