Release 2

#1. Display the information in one table (either table is fine).

>SELECT * FROM serface;
>1|North America|90|1
>2|South America|99|1
>3|mt olympus|-64|2

#2 Update an item that meets some condition (you choose a condition that makes sense).

UPDATE serface SET temp = -63 WHERE name='Mars';
SELECT * FROM serface;
1|North America|90|1
2|South America|99|1
3|mt olympus|-64|2

#3 Display the information in both tables using one query.

SELECT * FROM planets JOIN serface ON serface.planet_id = planets.id;
1|Earth|1|North America|90|1
1|Earth|2|South America|99|1
2|Mars|3|mt olympus|-64|2

#4 Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both.

SELECT planets.name, serface.name FROM planets JOIN serface ON serface.planet_id = planets.id;
Earth|North America
Earth|South America
Mars|mt olympus

#5 Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

DELETE FROM serface WHERE name = 'mt olympus';
SELECT * FROM serface;
1|North America|90|1
2|South America|99|1
