1. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

One thing I found is that Linux uses a monolythic kernel. This Kernel gives core functionality to the Linux user. Unlike the windows kernel that uses hybrid kernel witch is similar to the monolythic kernel it gives core functionality to the user. But has many other services moved elsewhere basically out of reach of the widows user. I also found this from google. "Modular programming is a software design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules, such that each contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality.""
