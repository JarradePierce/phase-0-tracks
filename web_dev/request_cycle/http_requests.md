2. What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?

By design, the POST request method requests that a web server accept the data enclosed in the body of the request message, most likely for storing it. It is often used when uploading a file or when submitting a completed web form. In contrast, the HTTP GET request method retrieves information from the server.


3. Optional bonus question: What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?

An HTTP cookie (also called web cookie, Internet cookie, browser cookie or simply cookie) is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the user's web browser while the user is browsing.
